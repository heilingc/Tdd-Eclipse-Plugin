Introduction:

The Test driven Development (TDD) is based on the idea to implement tests before
the feature. This Plug-in supports the developer to learn and use the process of TDD. 


Description:

The Tdd-Eclipse-Plugin supports the developer to learn and use the TDD principles.
It shows for every change of the code how much is covered by tests. If there is no
test currently available for the changed class the plug-in informs you and gives 
you also the possibility to create the test.
