<h1>Tdd-Eclipse-Plugin</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Test driven Development (TDD) is based on the idea to implement tests before
the feature. This Plug-in supports the developer to learn and use the process of TDD. 
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Tdd-Eclipse-Plugin supports the developer to learn and use the TDD principles.
It shows for every change of the code how much is covered by tests. If there is no
test currently available for the changed class the plug-in informs you and gives 
you also the possibility to create the test. 
</p>

</ul>

<h2>How Do Use</h2>

<p>	Before the plugin can be used for the project right click on the project and click on
	Tdd/Enable Tdd for Project. Now every time you save a file in this project all 
	unit tests are executed and the code coverage is calculated by ecl emma.
</p>

<p>	You can disable this behavior if you right click on the project again and you choose
	Tdd/Disable Tdd for Project.
</p>

<p>
	In the editor you can jump to the test and jump to the class backward when you
	rightclick on the editor and choose Tdd/Jump to Test or Tdd/Jump to Class.
	Alternatively you can also right click in the package explorer on any class
	and choose Tdd/Jump to Test or Tdd/Jump to Class.
</p><p>
	If no related class to the test exist or vice versa than instead you can create a
	related class by right clicking on the class in the package explorer or in the editor
	and choose Tdd/Create Class or Tdd/Create Test. A wizard will be opened with the right
	default values.
</p><p>
	The Tdd Plugin calculate the relation of class/test pairs by naming. If
		   your class have the name A your test must be named ATest per default.
		   (Under window/preference/tdd you can change tdd settings).
</p><p>
	If you want to create out of an Unit Test a Integration Test the 
	Extract Test Superclass Refactoring might be the right choice. Information
	about this refactoring you can find at <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Testcase%20Superclass.html">http://xunitpatterns.com/Testcase%20Superclass.html</a>.
	You can start the wizard by rightclicking on the test in the package explorer or in the editor
	and you choose Tdd/Extract Testcase Superclass.
</p><p>
	Sometimes it can be tricky to use a library which you use rarely. The TDD Plugin can help you
	by using Mocking Libraries. Right click on the editor and choose Tdd/Create Mock Template to open
	a Wizard which allow you to generate mocking source. You have only name your constraints.
	This feature can be used for JMock, Mockito and EasyMock. Generic Variables are not supported.
